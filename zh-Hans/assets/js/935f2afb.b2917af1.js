Note that ChatGPT is different from GPT-3. The main difference is that chatbots can remember your conversation history. Just like GPT-3, they can also answer questions, provide writing summary and analysis, write text or code, and more at a high level, which is an exciting prospect\u2014but the real value of chatbots is only accessible when you get specific with your prompts.
